My first repository on GitHub

I'm a journalist in NYC taking a data science course through Johns Hopkins instructors on Coursera. As part of the class I've created this GitHub account. I'm a novice so this is all a little intimidating, but I also feel motivated because I know how important it is to learn this material. Wish me luck!
